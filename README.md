# Arroyo

Arroyo is a stream-oriented Ruby client for [Amazon S3][s3]. When uploading and downloading, Arroyo
exposes the underlying HTTP request and response body streams, enabling efficient and flexible
data transfer.

**Warning:** This library is currently an incomplete sketch and not suitable for production use.

## Usage

Instantiate an `Arroyo::Client` with service account credentials:

```ruby
client = Arroyo::Client.new(access_key_id: "...", secret_access_key: "...", region: "us-east-1")
```

Open a bucket:

```ruby
bucket = client.buckets.open("my-bucket")
```

### Downloading

Download an object to a path on disk:

```ruby
bucket.download("README.md", "/path/to/README.md")
```

Download an object to a tempfile:

```ruby
require "tempfile"

Tempfile.open(["README", ".md"]) do |tempfile|
  bucket.download("README.md", tempfile)
end
```

Compute an objectâ€™s checksum 1 MB at a time:

```ruby
checksum = Digest::SHA256.new.tap do |digest|
  bucket.download("README.md") do |io|
    io.each(1.megabyte) { |chunk| digest << chunk }
  end
end.base64digest
```

### Uploading

Upload an object from a path on disk:

```ruby
bucket.upload("README.md", "/path/to/README.md")
```

Upload an object from a file:

```ruby
File.open("/path/to/README.md", "r") do |file|
  bucket.upload("README.md", file)
end
```

### Deleting

Delete an object:

```ruby
bucket.delete("README.md")
```
